	abstract = {With the impetuous improvement of cyber intelligence and networking technology, cybersecurity becomes an important area of research. Domain name system (DNS) has been an essential aspect of cyber security and a crucial part of internet services. The nameservers are responsible for the functionality and safety of their corresponding domain names. But due to the laggings of proper security and DNS misconfiguration, there is a chance to takeover subdomain from the assigned external services e.g., cloud platform, e-commerce or content delivery service, which can lead to several high severity risks. Due to trackless and easier exploitation effort, subdomain hijacking has become an alluring attack vector among the hackers, which raise serious concern on cyber security. This paper focuses on comprehensive analysis on subdomain takeover and figures out the security vulnerability reason and attack scenarios. Element for subdomain enumeration, subdomain takeover process and finally, a proposed inclusive prevention model of subdomain takeover have been discussed throughout the paper.},

	abstract = {The Domain Name System, DNS, is based on nameserver delegations, which introduce complex and subtle dependencies between names and nameservers. In this paper, we present results from a large scale survey of DNS, and show that these dependencies lead to a highly insecure naming system. We report specifically on three aspects of DNS security: the properties of the DNS trusted computing base, the extent and impact of existing vulnerabilities in the DNS infrastructure, and the ease with which attacks against DNS can be launched. The survey shows that a typical name depends on 46 servers on average, whose compromise can lead to domain hijacks, while names belonging to some countries depend on a few hundred servers. An attacker exploiting well-documented vulnerabilities in DNS nameservers can hijack more than 30\% of the names appearing in the Yahoo and DMOZ.org directories. And certain nameservers, especially in educational institutions, control as much as 10\% of the namespace.},

	abstract = {An attacker can obtain a valid TLS certiﬁcate for a domain by hijacking communication between a certiﬁcate authority (CA) and a victim domain. Performing domain validation from multiple vantage points can defend against these attacks. We explore the design space of multi-vantage-point domain validation to achieve (1) security via sufﬁciently diverse vantage points, (2) performance by ensuring low latency and overhead in certiﬁcate issuance, (3) manageability by complying with CA/Browser forum requirements, and requiring minimal changes to CA operations, and (4) a low benign failure rate for legitimate requests. Our opensource implementation was deployed by the Let’s Encrypt CA in February 2020, and has since secured the issuance of more than half a billion certiﬁcates during the ﬁrst year of its deployment. Using real-world operational data from Let’s Encrypt, we show that our approach has negligible latency and communication overhead, and a benign failure rate comparable to conventional designs with one vantage point. Finally, we evaluate the security improvements using a combination of ethically conducted real-world BGP hijacks, Internet-scale traceroute experiments, and a novel BGP simulation framework. We show that multi-vantage-point domain validation can thwart the vast majority of BGP attacks. Our work motivates the deployment of multi-vantage-point domain validation across the CA ecosystem to strengthen TLS certiﬁcate issuance and user privacy.},

In the absense of any explicit support to take advantage of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily. Tech- niques have been utilized to divide traffic somewhat evenly among the available paths. These techniques have been referred to as Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP). An unequal division of traffic among the available paths is generally preferable. Routers generally have no knowledge of traffic loading on distant links and therefore have no basis to optimize the allocation of traffic. Optimized Mulitpath is a compatible extension to OSPF, utilizing the Opaque LSA to distribute loading information, proposing a means to adjust forwarding, and providing an algorithm to make the adjustments gradually enough to insure stability yet provide reasonably fast ad- justment when needed.},

	doi = {10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.94},
	abstract = {Link-state routing with hop-by-hop forwarding is widely used in the Internet today. The current versions of these protocols, like OSPF, split traffic evenly over shortest paths based on link weights. However, optimizing the link weights for OSPF to the offered traffic is an NP-hard problem, and even the best setting of the weights can deviate significantly from an optimal distribution of the traffic. In this paper, we propose a new link-state routing protocol, PEFT, that splits traffic over multiple paths with an exponential penalty on longer paths. Unlike its predecessor, DEFT, our new protocol provably achieves optimal traffic engineering while retaining the simplicity of hop-by-hop forwarding. A gain of 15 \% in capacity utilization over OSPF is demonstrated using the Abilene topology and traffic traces. The new protocol also leads to significant reduction in the time needed to compute the best link weights. Both the protocol and the computational methods are developed in a new conceptual framework, called network entropy maximization, which is used to identify the traffic distributions that are not only optimal but also realizable by link-state routing.},

To get a good understanding of the deployment of HSTS, we conducted an in-depth measurement of the deployment of HSTS among Alexa top 1 million sites, and investigated bookmarks and navigation panels in different browsers. We found five types of threats, including transmission errors, redirection errors, field setting errors, the auto completion mechanism in bookmarks and the embedded addresses in navigation panels. To demonstrate defects we found, we designed an enhanced HTTPS stripping attack, which was upgraded from the original sslstrip attack. Finally, we gave three effective suggestions to eliminate these defects. This paper exposed various risks of HTTPS and HSTS, making it possible to deploy HTTPS and HSTS in a more secure way.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.},

	abstract = {We propose a new lookup system using blockchain and Distributed Hash Table (DHT). Blockchain allows this system to communicate from one node to another node directly without a trusted third party. DHT allows nodes participating in this system to store data distributedly and to propagate data efficiently. The maximum capacity of the blockchain of this system does not increase by adopting a mechanism setting an expiration period of data. In this paper, we describe our current system structure and report the result of measuring how the query time required for a lookup to any data changes depending on the network size and the ratio of off-line nodes.},

For almost 20 years, digital certificates have been a key aspect of Internet security. The certificates-detailed in the "The Digital Certificate" side-bar-are designed to establish the credentials of people doing business or otherwise communicating on the Web and to verify that they are who they say they are. However, several attacks this year by a hacker against organizations issuing certificates are creating doubts about Internet communications' safety in general and the digital-certificate model's integrity in particular. The attacker tried to break into at least three certificate authorities' systems and succeeded with two of the CAs.},
